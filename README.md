yes, a lot happens in that 0.1 percent

but 0.1 is still less than 99.9

chinese people, for example, are more human than they are chinese

showing up to the world and saying "hey, i look like these people so i should think, sound and talk like them too" is ridiculous

and this weakness is often exploited by people having zero regard for increasing divisions cost when campaigning for their leadership over it (theyve no other account to draw upon to fund their leadership)

while dismissing peoples differences appears insensitive, it promotes recognition of being human

and hints at depths which remain unexplored when people are left to fixate on their 0.1 percent membership
